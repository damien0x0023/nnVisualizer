[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/damien0x0023/rnnExplainer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/damien0x0023/rnnExplainer)

## Live Demo

For a live demo of this App, visit: https://damien0x0023.github.io/rnnExplainer/. Please note that try this demo with a screen which is larger than 8 inches and has a minimum resolution of 1280x720. I will appreciate if you can answer some [questions](https://forms.gle/c8kV8tHmsrPLTsx27) for me after the tour.

## Running Locally

Clone or download this repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:damien0x0023/rnnExplainer.git

# use degit if you don't want to download commit histories
degit damien0x0023/rnnExplainer
```

Install the dependencies:

```
npm install 
```
or
```
yarn
```

Then run RNN Explainer:

```
npm run dev
```
or
```
yarn dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](https://localhost:5000). You should see the Explainer running in your broswer.
